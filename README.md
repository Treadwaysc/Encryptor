# Encryptor
Fun side project to create an asymmetric encryptor so that I can practice and understand cryptography on a deeper level.
The goals of this project are: \n
  Generate encryption keys for symmetric and asymmetric encryption
  The ability to choose a file to encrypt and decrypt
  a digital signature generator and proofer
  implement a fast summetrical encryption and decryption process
